# Grade 12 Computer Science ISP

Overall expectations being assessed in this independent study project:

* A1. 	demonstrate the ability to use different data types and expressions when creating computer programs;
* A2. 	describe and use modular programming concepts and principles in the creation of computer programs;
* A4. 	use proper code maintenance techniques when creating computer programs.
* B1. 	demonstrate the ability to manage the software development process effectively, through all of its stages â€“ planning, development ... and closing;
* B2. 	apply standard project management techniques in the context of a student-managed ... project.
* C1. 	demonstrate the ability to apply modular design concepts in computer programs;

In all phases of this ISP, you will be guided by an exemplar produced by Mr. Gordon.

The emphasis in this ISP is on understanding and applying the process of software development. The greatest success has historically come to students who plan their deliverables according to a manageeable schedule and stick to their plan.

## Scope

Aim to create a modest application that solves a problem you care about. If you solve the problem well, it is highly likely that others will find your application useful as well. Challenge yourself with something new, but avoid overreaching.

## Due dates

Planning, development, and closing will occur by the start of March Break. You can set due dates for deliverables in your project. You are strongly recommended to plan deliverable dates by working around due dates for deliverables in your other classes.

Note that you will be granted significant opportunities to work in class, but that there is, like any Grade 12 university preparation course, an expectation that work be completed outside of class time as well.

## Proposal

Modify this document and add your responses to the following prompts below.

### What problem will your application solve?

*The everyday life of the average city-liver is stressful - we get it! You are consistently faced with empty time scattered throughout your precious day. Why not use that time to take a break, and challenge yourself with a simple game? While you're hop-hop-hopping from place to place, why not play 'Hop Hop Hop'?! The game exists in a world of floating sushi, where you must jump from piece to piece in order to stay afloat of the broken fortune cookies and chopsticks (ouch!). Studies have proven that small and challenging acts spread periodically throughout your day are not only brain-productive, but also fun!*

### What is your inspiration for this project?

*I am inspired by simple-looking, no-need-for-instruction applications. They are great ways to pass time, and have a massive market and demand at the moment. Why not jump onto the bandwagon? I have always been curious as to how the applications are built, and much like my 'Copter' game, enjoy the challenge of 'simple'.*

### What is your prior experience in this area?

*I have no experience with SpriteKit, but I have experience in simple Java and understand the needed features of such an app.*

### What are skills do you hope to acquire by completing this project?

*I would like to learn the basics of SpriteKit and 2D physics-based applications. This seems like a fair enough challenge considering my lack of past experience on the subject.*

### What dependencies, if any, will be required to complete your project?

*SpriteKit, and, of course, Mr. Gordon.*

### Rate the personal difficulty level of this project.

*I tend to lack understanding of Swift sytax [as well as the language itself], in comparison to other students in the ICS4U class. So I feel that this project will be immensely difficult for me.*

### Identify what you think your biggest challenge for successfully completing this ISP will be.

*Time-management, as well as staying focused on the functionality [as oppose to just the graphics and small details].*

### Make storyboards to indicate the user interface and/or functionality of your application.
